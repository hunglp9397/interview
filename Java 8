0	New feature in java 8																								
		Functional Interface																							
		Lamda Expression																							
		Stream																							
		Datetime API																							
		Method reference																							
		Optional 																							
																									
																									
	Optional ? Why use Optional																								
																									
		Optional is a container type which can contain value or null value																							
																									
		Optinal encapsulation null or not null value,readable help avoid null check so avoid NullPointerException in runtime																							
																									
																									
	Difference between Map and flatMap																								
																									
		Both map and flat Map can apply to Stream and both return a Stream																							
																									
				Map 				flatMap																	
																									
			The function passed to map() operation returns				The funciton pass to flatMap() operation return multiple value for output																		
			a single value for single input																						
																									
			One to one Mapping				one to many mapping 																		
																									
			Used only for transformation				flatMap() is used both for transformation and mapping																		
																									
	Lamda expression ?																								
																									
		Lamda expression is a anonymous function, which not have			name	name 																			
																									
						return type																			
																									
						access modifier																			
																									
																									
																									
	Functional interface ?																								
																									
		Functional interface is the interface which have only one abstract method																							
																									
		Example	Comparable, Runable																						
																									
																									
																									
																									
																									
																									
	Default method in interface																								
																									
		Contain body																							
		Invoked by using the name of Interface																							
		The class implement this interface not require to implement default method																							
		We can add new feature on interface that not effect the class implement																							
																									
	Static method in Interface:																								
																									
																									
		Contain body																							
		is invoked by using the name of Interface																							
		Defind the utility method																							
		CAN NOT  OVERRIDE																							
																									
	Method Reference 																								
		Method reference are special type of lamda expression																							
																									
		Used to create lamda expression by refer exist method 				Static  method																			
						Instance method of particular object																			
						Constructor																			
																									
																									
	Different between Intermediate and Terminal Operations in Java 8 Stream																								
																									
		Firstly, Intermediate operations : filter(), map(), ... 																							
		Termial operation  : findFirst(), findAny(), collect()																							
																									
		The main diference is : 		Can reuse the stream after an intermediate operator But terminal operator can not																					
																									
		Example : 	Can call map() or flatMap() after call filter()																						
																									
			Can not call another operator after forEach()																						
																									
																									
	Different between Collection and Stream																								
																									
		Collection is the datastructure																							
																									
																									
																									
																									
		Stream is not the data structure																							
		Stream is immutable Object,No change the data																							
		Stream can not get element by index 																							
																									
																									
																									
	Why Functional Interface have only one abstract method ?
