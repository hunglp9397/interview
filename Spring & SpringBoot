1	Dependency injection in Spring											
												
		Suppose we have the class Vehicle, In the class Client, in the class Client we have object class ProductService										
		In the class Client we need use the method of the productService. So exmaple I create the insance of ProductService in the constructor of the Class Client										
		So The Client depend on the ProductService										
		So Suppose we need change the ProductService into the PayloadService, Need change this in the constructor										
		It is the problem										
		So Spring came to solve this problem										
		We only need declare the Bean in the spring.xml or using annotaion @Autowired to inject the bean. So 										
		So DI concept in Spring is, Spring will find the implement of d										
												
	Advantage : 											
		A basic benefit of dependency injection is decrease coupling between class and dependency										
		So program become more reusable, testable, maintainable										
2	IOC là gì											
												
												
												
3	What is Auto-wiring ?											
		We declare annotaion @Service on the class serviceLayer										
		Declare annotation @Autowired in the controller class Spring find the implement of the Interface and inject 										
4	How to inject bean											
		Constructor-injection										
		Property Injection										
		Method Injection										
5	Scope in spring 											
												
		Singleton 	When define a bean with singleton scope, The container create a single instance of that bean									
			All request for that bean will return the same object, which is cached									
			All modification to the object will be reflect to the bean									
			The scope is the default value if no other scope is specified									
												
												
		Prototype	A bean with the prototye scope will return a different instance everty time it request from the container									
												
												
		Request										
												
		Session										
												
												
6	What is Singleton Pattern, How to implement Singleton ?											
												
		Concept : 										
												
			Singleton is a pattern of creational design pattern, that the class has only one instance and provide a global access point to thí instance									
												
		Implement 										
			Create private constructor to prevent access from ouside 									
												
			Use 'private static final' variable to ensure var only init in class									
												
			Have method 'public static ' to return instance									
												
												
												
7	Explain Spring LifeCircle											
												
		@PostContstruct : 										
			Spring call the method which annotation @PostConstruct only one, after the init the bean									
												
												
												
												
		@PreDestroy :										
			Spring call the method which annotaion @PreDestroy only one, Before remove the bean from aplication context									
												
												
												
8	Different between @GetForEntity vs @GetForObject											
												
												
		GetForObject is basicly is a method in rest template, will only return the object 										
												
		GetForEntity is basicly is a method in rest template, return the object, the body , the statusCode, the header										
												
		Ngoài ra, ta dùng method exchange 										
												
												
9	In RestAPI , You return the ResponseEntity, So what is advantage of ResponseEntity ?											
												
		Advantage of ResponseEntity is can return the 			HTTP Status example OK, Bad Request							
					The body							
					The headers							
												
												
												
10	How to validators in Spring											
		We create the CustomValidator and then Implement Validator Class										
												
		So override 2 method : supports() , validate()										
												
			In the method validate(), you validate logic business and set Error 									
												
11	How to configure logging in SpringBoot Application											
												
		Because Spring Boot support Logging, Log4J2, So we have 2 options : 										
												
				Option 1 : 	Config  Logging level in application.properties			Example : 	logging.level.spring.framework = Debug			
												
				Option 2 	Cra							
												
12	What are the step to deploy SpringBoot as  JAR or WAR files											
												
			Firstly, add plugin int the pom.xml			spring-boot-maven-plugin						
												
			Then, Set the packaging in the pom.xml to jar or war									
												
												
												
												
13	What is the step to connect an external database like MYSQL or Orcale											
												
		Firstly 	Add dependency MYSQL CONNECTOR to pom.xml									
		Secondly	Config information of DB such as : URL, username, password, dialect    in the application.properties									
												
												
14	Anotation @RestController 											
												
		Basicly, @RestController is combination of @Controller  and @ResponseBody, Use to create restfull controller										
												
		It convert the response result to JSON or XML										
												
												
15	What is the default application server when click 'Run as Application'											
												
		Because default server application is Tomcat, So it will init tomcat server										
												
16	Why do we need Spring Profiles											
												
		When develop, we work with multiple environment such as : DEV, Product										
												
		So we need Spring Profile, such as : application-dev.properties, application-prod.properties ...										
												
17	Can override or replace the Tomcat server in SpringBoot											
												
		Yes, use 'spring-boot-starter-jetty' as a dependency injection for each project 										
												
18	Can disable the default web server in the SpringBoot Applicaiton :											
												
		Yes, can edit on file application.properties : 			spring.main.web-application.type = none							
												
19	What does the annotaion @SpringBootApplication do internally											
												
		@SpringBootApplication is the annotaion include 			@Configuration							
					@EnableAutoConfiguration							
					@ComponentScan							
												
20	Difference between @RestController and @Controller											
												
		@RestController include @Controller and @ResponseBody, basicly return the object into JSON or XML										
												
		@Controller basicly map the model object to View or Template, so readable										
												
21	Java Bean VS Spring Bean											
												
												
												
												
22	Khi sử dụng @Autowired, instance được tạo ra trong bộ nhớ nào ?											
												
		Spring IOC container										
												
23	Difference between @Bean and @Autowired											
												
												
												
24	Spring AOP											
		1 kĩ thuật lập trình dùng để tách logic chương trình thành các phần riêng biệt										
												
		Trong Spring AOP có 4 loại advice được hỗ trợ : 										
												
			Before Advice : 		Chạy trước khi method được thực thi							
												
			After returning advice : 		Chạy sau khi method trả về một kết quả							
												
			After throwing advice :		Chạy khi method ném ra một exception							
												
			Around advice:		Chạy khi method được thực thi (Bao gồm 4 loại advice)							
												
												
25	@Component vs @Bean											
												
												
												
26	JPA VS Hibernate vs Mybatis
