1	Difference between ArayList and LinkedList																								
																									
				ArrayList				LinkedList																	
																									
		Same		Each element added by order																					
				Can add null element																					
																									
		Diference																							
																									
			About data structre	Array				LinkedList																	
																									
																									
			About complexy	O(1) if not need improve size				O(1)																	
				O(n) if need improve size																					
																									
				Slow because need sort after delete or add (O(n))				Fast because only need update reference tail 																	
			About add /delete					O(1)																	
																									
																									
			About operation get()	Fast because just get element by index				Slow because need iterating each element start to end																	
																									
																									
																									
			About memory	ArrayList use less memory than LinkedList																					
																									
2	Difference between List and Set																								
																									
			List				Set																		
																									
		The List is ordered sequence				The Set is unorderd sequence																			
																									
		List allow duplicate elements				Set doesn't allow duplicate elements																			
																									
		Can access position element				Can not access position element																			
																									
		Can store mulitple null element				Can store only one null element																			
																									
																									
																									
3	How HashMap internal working																								
																									
		When create HashMap																							
			HashMap myMaps = new HashMap<String, Integer > ()																						
																									
		Its create 16 bucket, each bucket is a linked list			1	9																			
					2	10																			
					3	11																			
					4	12																			
					5	13																			
					6	14																			
					7	15																			
					8	16																			
																									
																									
		When put value to HashMap 		myMaps.put("a", 1)																					
																									
		It create 1 linkedlist, have 4 part : 		key :  a																					
				value : 1																					
				hash: 0x12345																					
				next : null																					
																									
																									
			hash = hashCode(key) = hashCode("a") = 0x2123																						
																									
			index = hash & (n -1 ) = 4 																						
																									
5	How HashSet internal working ?																								
																									
		When we create HashSet, It internally create HashMap, 																							
		If we insert element into HsshSet, It will also put the key is element and the value is the final Object PRESENT																							
		So HashSet only store distinct value 																							
																									
																									
																									
																									
																									
6	Different between HashMap and HashTable																								
																									
																									
			HashMap			HashTable																			
																									
		No synchronized			Synchronnized																				
		No thread safe			Thread safle																				
		Allow 1 null Key			Not allow null key or null value																				
		Multiple Null value																							
																									
																									
7	Different between List and ArrayList																								
																									
			List			ArrayLIst																			
																									
		Is Fixed Size			Dynamic size, increase size if required																				
																									
		Only Store Primitive Value			Store Primitive And Object type																				
																									
		Array Is faster than ArrayList because ArrayList is dynamic																							
																									
8	HashMap vs LinkedHashMap																								
																									
		Major diferrent : 	Linked HashMap store and trace element by order																						
																									
																									
			HashMap		Linked HashMap																				
																									
			Low memory		More memory																				
																									
			DS liên kết đơn		DS liên kết đôi
